# Excalibur Summary
A young knight embarks on a quest to ensure another successful harvest season for his home town, Marisacordia. He alone must journey outside the borders, an act forbidden by law since the town's birth. He is gifted several weapons and artifacts for the journey and the town prays to the Mariscordian gods to guide his every step. The path ahead is treacherous, winding through unforgiving terrain intent on testing the young knight's resolve. Each step echoes with the weight of uncertainty, the ground beneath him a shifting canvas of peril. Yet, he must press on, driven by a purpose in his family, friends, neighbours and home. A purpose that refuses to be extinguished by the looming spectres fear and doubt. He soon learns the truth behind the seemingly eternal success of Mariscordia and is faced with a grave choice: appease the gods of Marisacordia or watch as it burns to the ground!
